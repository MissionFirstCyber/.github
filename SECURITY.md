# Security Policy

We take security seriously, especially for mission-critical and public-sector contexts.

## Supported projects / branches
We accept vulnerability reports for actively maintained repositories and the `main` branch unless a repo states otherwise.

## Reporting a vulnerability
**Please do not open public issues for security problems.**  
Email **security@missionfirstcyber.com** with:
- Affected repo and commit/Version
- Technical description and impact
- Steps to reproduce and PoC (if available)
- Any relevant logs or screenshots

Optional encrypted reporting: (PGP key coming soon)

## Our process
- **Acknowledgment:** within **3 business days**
- **Triage & owner assignment:** typically within **7 days**
- **Fix target:** we aim for **90 days** from acknowledgment, adjusted by severity/complexity
- **Credit:** weâ€™re happy to acknowledge reporters, unless you prefer anonymity

## Scope
In-scope: vulnerabilities in our public repositories.  
Out-of-scope examples:
- Clickjacking on non-sensitive pages without impact
- Missing security headers without proven exploitability
- Issues requiring unlikely/unsupported configurations

Thank you for helping us keep users and missions safe.
