## What we do

Mission First Cyber (M1Cyber) delivers solutions across **AI**, **Data Intelligence**, and **DevSecOps** with a focus on federal and public-sector missions. We build field-ready kits, automation, and training that reduce complexity and accelerate outcomes.

- **Detect. Investigate. Eradicate. Monitor.** – Our Fly-Away Kits and content enable rapid deploys in air-gapped environments.  
- **Data pipelines at scale** – From packet to product: Zeek/Suricata → Kafka → analytics/search.  
- **DevSecOps** – Packer/Terraform/Ansible blueprints for reproducible, compliant stacks.  
- **Training** – Hands-on labs, PCAP-backed exercises, and instructor materials.

## Repository conventions

- **Naming:** `area-purpose`.  
- **Branches:** `main` is protected; use feature branches and PRs.  
- **Docs:** Each repo includes a `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `SECURITY.md`.  
- **Licensing:** Default to Apache-2.0 unless otherwise required; check each repo’s `LICENSE`.

## Get started

If you’re here to **use** our work:
1. Browse the Featured Projects above or the pinned repos.
2. Follow each repo’s `README` for prerequisites, quickstart, and support.

If you’d like to **contribute**:
1. Read our org-wide [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MissionFirstCyber/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/MissionFirstCyber/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Security & responsible disclosure

We take security seriously—especially for public-sector environments.

- Report vulnerabilities privately to **security@missionfirstcyber.com**.
- Please avoid filing public issues for exploitable findings.
- We aim to acknowledge within 3 business days and coordinate disclosure.

## Compliance context

Many projects here are designed with common federal guidance in mind (e.g., event logging baselines, SBOM/SCRM considerations, and zero-trust principles). Repos may reference mappings to standards such as **NIST 800-53/171**, **CMMC 2.0**, and relevant Executive Orders where appropriate. Always validate mappings against your own governance requirements.

## Community & support

- **Bugs / Features:** Open issues in the relevant repo with clear reproduction steps.
